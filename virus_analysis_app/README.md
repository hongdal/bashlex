# script_code_tracker
This is a project about my Final project in CPSC8700 course at Clemson University.  

[Course(Introduction to Software Development)](https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~malloy/courses/8700-2018/index.html)

# How to use this Application.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:guozetang/script_code_tracker.git
cd script_code_tracker
python3.5 main.py
```

# Why I build this application.
## Script Tracker
When I begin to do a research, I like to download some scripts about this research from the Internet. After that, I may read the abstract about each script. If I find some good idea in the script, I save this script in the script folder on my computer because I think I will read it in the future. Unfortunately, I may forget that why I save this script or the name of this script after a week. I would like to find an application to help me to manage the scripts which I need to read. But most of the script manager application just can help me to have a good reader experience. And these applications can’t tell me which script is important and urgent.

## Code TODO list Tracker
I like to use VS Code application to write python code when I am working. I write TODO flag in the source code file when I find that I need to complete some function in this file in the future. And I also found a plug-in in this application which can collects the TODO task in my code to build the TODO list for me. However, it just helps me to find the TODO task in one project. And it also can’t tell me which TODO is the most urgency one or the most important one for me. So, it can’t help me to find the most important task which I need to finish now.

## Process For this Application
- 08/01/2018 Script Tracker V1.0(Master)
- (Plan) Before 08/10/2018 Script&CodeTask Tracker V2.0(Master) I hope I can finish it.

## Introduce about the branch
- **Master**: Completed and you can just use it on your computer.
- **Dev**: I use this branch to add some function which I want make this application more powerful.
- **Design**: I use this branch to try different pattern in this Application.

I hope you like this application. Please feel free to send Email to me if you have some issues with this application.
